  <h3 align="center">CVE-2019-15033</h3>
  <p align="center">Blind Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) on Pydio Community</p>
</p>

---

### Summary

The Pydio is a “modern file management platform built according to your business needs and regulations” and with the CVE-2019-15033 an attacker can use one of its main features to send a specific payload to force the backend to defraud requisitions for internal assets.

---

### Impact

An attacker could take advantage of the vulnerability to make Pydio make forged internal IP requests on a network, mapping and accessing files from an internal network - for greater effectiveness, this could be automated and correlated to a list of services and files presumably that the target company uses. In addition, there is a very significant margin of being able to align this Blind SSRF with some specific scenario and achieve a RCE vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited without authentication because another feature of Pydio is the creation and making of folders available for third parties to upload and download files.

---

### Mitigation

Upgrade your Pydio application to last version available.
