### Summary

My research focus is vulnerability discovery in applications/services and exploit devlopment, I have fun bypassing modern defenses, exploring systems and playing with new technologies and in parallel: sharing some of my research notes on [my blog](https://heitorgouvea.me); Here, you can find some of my experiments, advisories and analysis of advisories from others researchers.
