### Summary

I’m an Independent Researcher based in São Paulo with Software Development background and 5 years of experience in the offensive security industry. My research focus is vulnerability discovery in applications/services. I have fun bypassing modern defenses, exploring systems and playing with new technologies and in parallel: sharing some of my research notes on [my blog](https://heitorgouvea.me);
